<h5>
<a id="tldr-my-travel-planning-takes-too-much-time-because-my-travel-lust-needs-more-than-visiting-the-common-touristic-places-to-get-satisfied" class="anchor" href="#tldr-my-travel-planning-takes-too-much-time-because-my-travel-lust-needs-more-than-visiting-the-common-touristic-places-to-get-satisfied" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TLDR: My travel planning takes too much time, because my travel lust needs more than visiting the common touristic places to get satisfied.</h5>

<p>I realised in the last couple of months that even though I know which region/country I would like to visit in the future, I do not know where I would like to go exactly. Which spots are the one I would like to visit? I need the experience of other people.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am not the usual tourist kind of person. I like to see places which are not well known. The best places are usually the ones that are hard to find, and is not full of people. I need to find those.</p>

<p>Using Youtube, Google Maps, Foursquare, Pinterest and Instagram, its possible for me to find these places, however its a pain. I takes too much time. </p>

<p>My problem with Foursquare, and other review based apps is that its too objective. 4.5/5 stars with reviews like "Beautiful place, must visit".
I do not need this. I need the real human factor in it.</p>

<p>To do this, I need to identify myself with other people. Its not enough to see one review of a beach. I need to see what other places this person visited during his journey, and I would like to see the experience he had. After I see this, and I identify myself with someone I can finally know where I would like to go exactly.</p>

<a id="the-audience" class="anchor" href="#the-audience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The audience</h4>

<ul>
<li>My main target uploading content are world travellers, travel vloggers.</li>
<li>Target reader audience could be anyone who loves to travel to unsual but awesome places</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="the-plan" class="anchor" href="#the-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The plan</h4>

<p>The apps target audience is not the typical tourist, who wants to see the Eiffel tower and goes to Paris, and checks out 3 museums and the tower while staying in the hotel. Everyone can do that without another app. </p>

<p>The app has to show places which are not widely known, "Hidden gems" if you wish. </p>

<p>People love to collect. I for example love to categorise my travels in Google Photos into Albums, however there is no way for me to create a journey from it. I cannot add comments, or put albums in albums to make a journey...
With Guidee, I would be able to upload my travel journey into the app with images, and videos and pin the journey on the map. A journey has highlights (eg: unknown beach) which they can add a description and images/videos. Then I could share this with people I like, or just make it public if I will, and people could give their feedback.</p>

<p>Journeys can be commented on, made private, one could steal highlights from them to start and plan their own future journey. </p>
